Experiment - 3

Brace expansion is used to generate discretionary strings of characters. Braces contain a comma-separated list of strings, or a sequence expression. The result includes the text that precedes or follows the brace definition.

Approch -- To use brace expansion
Syntax for brace expansion {}
Syntax for sequence expression with brace expansion {start..stop..step}

Example
echo {1..10..2}
Here we tried to use brace expansion with sequence expression and printed the values starting from 1 to 20 where the steps taken is 2.
